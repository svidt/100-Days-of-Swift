// Operators are the mathematical symbols like " + " and " - ", here's an example.

import Foundation

let firstScore = 12
let secondScore = 4

let total = firstScore + secondScore // addition
let difference = firstScore - secondScore // subtraction

let product = firstScore * secondScore // multiplication
let divided = firstScore / secondScore // division


// remainder after division. It calculates how many times a number can fit inside another, then returns the values of what's left. Foe example, we can set *secondScore* to **4**, and do *13 % secondScore*, we will get back **1**, because *4* fits into *13* three times with a remainder of *1*.

let remainder = 13 % secondScore
