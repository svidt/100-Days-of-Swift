// Swift has a shortcut for combining one operator with an assignment. They each look like " + , - , * , / " but with an " = " attached to the end them. In the example, *score* 95, *score* -= 5 ( subtracts 5 points and assign it back to the variable *score*. It works on Strings as well.

var score = 95
score -= 5
