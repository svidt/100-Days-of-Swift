// Swift has multiple operators that can perform comparison.

import Foundation

let firstScore = 6
let secondScore = 4

firstScore == secondScore // equal to
firstScore != secondScore // not-equal to

firstScore < secondScore // greater than
firstScore >= secondScore // less than, or equal to!


//Comparison also work on Strings, since there's a natrual alphabetical order.
"Taylor" <= "Swift"
