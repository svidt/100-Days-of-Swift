// Tuples allow you to store several types values together in a single value, very similar to an Array but with three key differences. First, you can't add or remove items from a tuple, a tuple is fixed in size. Second, you can't change the type of item in a typle. Third, you can access items using either numerical posotions or by name. Bonus: You can change the values inside a Tuple, but not it's type of value. Be careful, Swift crashes if you try and read a number or a name that doesn't exsist.
