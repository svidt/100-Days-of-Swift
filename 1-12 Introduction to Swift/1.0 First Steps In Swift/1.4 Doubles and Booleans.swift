// There are two data types to store fractional numbers. **Float** and **Double**.

// The official Apple recommendation is to always use *Double* since it has the most accuracy.

// A Double is short for "double-precision floating-point number" and is used when working with any kind of decimal number. *Doubles* does still have limitations though, but much less so than *Floats*.

// Boolean can be either True or False, not both - and no maybe or perhaps!

var pi = 3.141

// Booleans can be either true or false
var awesome = true
