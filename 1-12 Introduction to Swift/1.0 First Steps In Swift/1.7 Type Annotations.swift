// Even though Swift is type inferenced - meaning it can figure out at compile time - what type each Constant and Variable is. Sometimes you may want to explicitly define each type.

// Keep in mind that all *Type Anootations* start with a capital letter, while *variable* and *constants* does not. This is standard Swift coding convention.
