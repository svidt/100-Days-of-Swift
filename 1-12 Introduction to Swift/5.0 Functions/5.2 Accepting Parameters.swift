// Functions become much more powerful when they can be customized each time you run them. That's where Parameters come in, you can make your Funtion in a way so they accept an input and take that input into consideration when you run them.
// You do this by; using the **func** keyword, then the name of the function, then brackets " ( ) ", then the name of the parameter and finally define what type of input it should expect.

import Foundation


func square(number: Int) {
    print(number * number)
}
