# 100 Days of Swift
2023 Svidt â€“ 
A repository for my personal journey through Paul- @twostraws 100 Days of Swift.


## First steps in Swift
**1.1 Variables**  
Variables get their name because they can vary. No need to write the 'var' keyword again when changing the same variable.
```
var str = "Hello, GitHub"   
str = "Goodbye, GitHub"
```
**1.2 Strings and Integers** 
```
var greeting = "Hello, GitHub"   
var number = 10   
var largeNumber = 1_000_000   
```
**1.3 Multi-line Strings**  
Text with triple quotes ( """) can show text over multiple lines. While Text with triple quotes along with ( \ ) introduces a line-break.
````
var str1 = """
This text goes
over multiple
lines.
"""
var str2 = """
While this text \   
really does go \   
over multiple \   
lines
"""
```
